    <h2>Description:-</h2>
    <p>Mumbai, often called the "City of Dreams," is the bustling financial and entertainment capital of 
    India. Located on the western coast, it is known for its stunning Marine Drive and the iconic Gateway 
    of India. A city of contrasts, Mumbai houses India's largest slums alongside luxurious skyscrapers 
    and elite neighborhoods. The city is a melting pot of diverse cultures, languages, and cuisines, 
    reflecting India’s rich heritage. Known for its lively nightlife, historic Bollywood film industry, 
    and street food like vada pav and pav bhaji, Mumbai is vibrant and always buzzing. With a humid 
    tropical climate and one of the busiest ports in the country, Mumbai is also an economic powerhouse 
    and a center for trade, technology, and innovation. The famous local trains and dabbawalas 
    (lunchbox deliverymen) showcase the city’s spirit of resilience and teamwork.</p>
